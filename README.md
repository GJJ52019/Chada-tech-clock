basic c++ app for snhu210 

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
project was to build an app that reads the current time out and then allows the user to add hours minutes or seconds to the time and redisplay it

## What did you do particularly well?
I feel like I did the comments well. 

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Currently there is two bugs one has to do with out putting times that are single digits as it does not put the leading zero. the second is not clearing the screen. I am still a ways out from learning to properly secure c++ apps and have no real experience or even any understanding yet of risk this program could present. Hopefully covered in upcoming courses.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I struggled with passing infromation between functions for a long time seems simple and i understood the concept just my execution was not what was needed.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Organization of code by creativly commenting throughout allowed me to use this app to help build out project 3's app without proper comments I dont think i would have gone back to this app as easy.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I am not sure what there is to maintain about this app it is plenty readable but the functions in it really are not transferable they can be used for templates to build out other programs but their content is rather limited.
